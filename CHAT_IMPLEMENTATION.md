  - Orange: Major delay (16-60 min)
  - Red: Drastic delay (>60 min)

## ðŸš€ Demo Pages

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Firebase Integration
- Uses existing RTDB.ts service
- Chat rooms organized by train ID
- Real-time listeners for live updates
- Message persistence and cleanup

### User Experience
- **Intuitive three-tab interface** matching the Android app
- **Quick report buttons** for common train situations
- **Visual feedback** for message states
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient real-time updates** with Firebase listeners

## ðŸ“± How to Use

1. **Navigate to a train page**: `/train?gtfsId=SOME_TRAIN_ID`
2. **Switch to Chat tab** to see the messaging interface
3. **Type messages** or use quick report buttons
4. **Toggle Reports-only** to filter important updates
5. **Your messages appear in your train's delay color**

The chat system is now fully functional and matches the Android TrainActivity's chat features! Users can communicate about train conditions, delays, and other relevant information in real-time.
